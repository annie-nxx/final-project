          Vovinam uses the force and reaction of the opponent, it is based on the hard and soft principle, as in, how forcefully a defender counters the force of an attack that is armed and unarmed, 
          and it also trains your mind and body. Vovinam practices with and without weapons. The weapons that are used when teaching are knives, long and short stick, swords, sabre, folding fans, axe, staff and spears.
